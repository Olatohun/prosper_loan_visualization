# Prosper Loan Data Explanation
## by Maryam Oyeyiola


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

> This data [dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0) explains the variables in the data set.


## Summary of Findings

> >More people took out laons in 2013 compared to other years, however, regardless of the year, people mostly take out loan in the first quarter (January-March) and fourth quarter (October-December)

>Owning a prperty or having a verifiable income does not guarantee securing a loan from Prosper. However, having a job helps in securing a loan, and also have a very high income betters the chances of securing a high loan

>To be a high income earner, pursuing a career as a judge, pharmacist or a doctor can put you in that income range with an income as high as 150000/yr

>Paying back the loan and borrowerrate and BorroweAPR on time, that is over a short period of 12 to 36 months increases the prosper score

## Key Insights for Presentation

> My focus for the presentation covered the influence of the borrowers' Monthly Loan Payment, employment status, income range, their profession and the time of the year on the Loan Amount they get. I start by intoducing the total Loan Amount variable, followed by the distributions of related variables including Monthly Loan Payment, BorrowerRate and BorrowerAPR, then I plot scatter plots showing correlations between Loan Amount and Monthly Loan Payment.

> After which I introduced the categorical variables that have effect on whether a loan is granted or not as well as the amount granted. I only focused on employment status, income range, professions and quarter of the year, since an individual has to have a job where he earns at least 1 dollar to be granted a loan. 

> Moving on I used multivariate explorations to further depict the ralationship other categorical variable may have on the loan amount granted. I showed how owing a property can affect the prosper score of a borrower and the amount of loan they get as well as the effect of income range on the loan amount coupled with the prosper score
